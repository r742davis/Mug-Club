# Mug Club

### Current Development Stage (as of May 15th, 2019)
Right now, I am putting together wireframes of the app and figuring out the UX and functionality of the app. I personally believe tha UX design should come before functionality. This is especially true since most people who use this app will be inebriated at a bar, so ease of use is critical to the app's overall success.

I will be having a meeting with one of the managers at the Madison Bear Garden about what they want from the app and the interface they need on their desktop side.

### App Idea


A full stack React Native app that checks you into Mug Club at the Madison Bear Garden. The Bear currently uses an Excel spreadsheet and laptop computer to look through hundreds of names in order to find out whether someone has completed their series of challenges and is officially in their Mug Club. What I plan to do is create an iOS app and desktop application so the customer can quickly pull up their ID and the Bear employees can check the ID via their companion website.

The app is simple but it requires both an easy-to-use frontend UI and a backend database to store the customer information securely. There are many features I would like to add to the app, BUT the first and only focus for now is the 'Mug Club ID lookup' functionality.

### Tech Stack:
React Native, Ruby on Rails, Sass, Authentication-JWTs
