# Mug Club

## Current Development Stage - June 25th, 2019
#### Backend Creation

After speaking with Bear employees, I decided to make the first iteration of the app only business-side and then add customer usage later. The primary use is for accessing customer database and generating new customers via bar employee access of internet connected devices.

The app is simple but it requires both an easy-to-use frontend UI and a backend database to store the customer information securely. There are many features I would like to add to the app, BUT the first and only focus for now is the 'Mug Club ID lookup' functionality.

## Motivation

A full stack React Native app that checks you into Mug Club at the Madison Bear Garden. The Bear currently uses an Excel spreadsheet and laptop computer to look through over a thousand names in order to find out whether someone has completed their series of challenges and is officially in their Mug Club. What I plan to do is create an iOS app and desktop application so the customer can quickly pull up their ID and the Bear employees can check the ID via the companion website.
